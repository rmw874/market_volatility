# Purpose of project

Exploring the cross-section of crypto and stocks. More specifically, the relationship between the volatilities.
Any two assets that can be fetched from FMP or Binance can be compared. This means, the code, with some tweaking, can compare stocks with stocks, stocks with crypto and crypto with crypto.
The current setup favors comparison between stock and crypto.
I built this, as I wanted to explore whether $MSTR has essentially become a proxy for BTC due to their large holding of bitcoin.

## Specific use (MSTR and BTC)

The analysis shows a moderately strong relationship that decays gradually over time, suggesting MSTR and BTC respond to similar market forces but retain some independent characteristics.
